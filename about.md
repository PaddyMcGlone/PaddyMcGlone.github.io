My name is Patrick 'Paddy' McGlone, I am a software engineer based in Belfast, Northern Ireland. I am currently on a journey to further myself as an engineer and using this blog to note my progress.

The hope is that there is someone out there like me and a little confused on a topic and this blog might be able to explain something a little further.

Thanks for reading & why not drop me a line using my contact details below if you want to chat further.
