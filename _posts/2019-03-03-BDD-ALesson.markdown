## Stage one - denial

When i started working for my current company, i struggled with with concept of behaviour driven development. I came from a background of fix the problem, test the fix throughly by hand and then release, what some would say the 'old school' approach to software development.

The idea that writing tests before you wrote your actual 'production' code sounded so foreign to me and whilst trying to learn this new development approach a number of questions ran through my head:

- Why would you develop code like that?
- What benifit would it bring to my solution, other than taking longer to create.
- How would you know what tests to write to start with..

All reasonable questions and questions many inexperienced developers ask themselves at the start of their BDD journey.
Being unable to answer these questions suitable, I created what i thought was a development practice which worked for me:

- Create the code fix first
- Browser test it
- Add some tests to keep the 'reviewer' happy.

Im not proud of this approach, but its important to be thruthful, this is how i used to develop professional software prior to BDD!

## Stage two - the pain

At the time i was working on a very busy project and our development team was put under alot of pressure to deliver. When inexperienced developers are put under such pressure, they normally resort to the aforementioned approach, their comfort zone. Following this approach is easy and it allows a developer to produce results quickly.

However, by following this approach what normally happens is the developer will solve problem 'A', but what about problem 'B' and problem 'C' that the customer will find during their testing / acceptance cycle?

Recently, I have worked with customers that dont appreciate the 'full picture' until they have the software solution in front of them and it forces them to determine all of the solutions requirements in order to 'pass through test'.

It can be very fustrating to work with customers like this, but unfortunatley many customers follow this approach and dont appreciate all of a storys requirements until its delivered to them.

When the customer discovers problem 'B', 'C' etc etc. The delivered solution will not be accepted by the customer, which can mean story points cannot be realised or possibly an entire release can be rejected if working within a support realm.

The outcome for the company will be lose in revenue due to the time spent resolving these 'unforeseen issues' and a possible lack of trust from the customer.

## Stage three - doing it right
